Interpreter for the Julia PL using Java

youtube presentation/explanation:

This repository contains the assignment requirements, reports, and code that went into developing the Julia Interpreter. It must remain private to avoid plagiarism, per my instructor's request.

What is an interpreter?
"An interpreter is a program that reads source code written in a programming language and executes it line by line. This is in contrast to a compiler, which converts source code into machine code that can be directly executed by the computer's processor."

Building a Julia interpreter hones software engineering skills by requiring the developer to understand the inner workings of a programming language and how to implement an interpreter from scratch.
